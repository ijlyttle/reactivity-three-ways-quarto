# Deployment

In time, I will reconstruct from my code (and my notes) the tricks and sorcery I used to deploy these apps.

## Shiny

Not a lot of trickery here; I got an shinyapps account and I used the deployment service built into the RStudio IDE.

## Dash

Some trickery here to deploy to Heroku.

## Observable

The code is developed in a "deployed" state; I hit the "Publish" button.

That said, there are some interesting embedding possibilities and, as of Spring 2021, capability to run interactively via Quarto.
